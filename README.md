# LiveSplit.KTANE
Autosplitter for the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

Requires you to start timer manually, but will split after each bomb if you have more than 7 splits defined. Otherwise, it will split at the end of each section.

When running it will show your best time for the current bomb if one exists.
